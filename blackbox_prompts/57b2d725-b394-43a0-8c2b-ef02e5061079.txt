Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: If Link is not moving, where will he put the projectile he's carrying?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "If Link is not moving, where will he put the projectile he's carrying?")
APIResults: The context-sensitive button mechanic allows one button to serve a variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects.  Human: Silence the smoke detector .[e] The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. For example, if Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still.[f].
