Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: How many exhibition events per year does the NASCAR Sprint Cup have?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How many exhibition events per year does the NASCAR Sprint Cup have?")
APIResults: Various auto racing organizations hold exhibition events; these events usually award no championship points to participants, but they do offer prize money to participants. The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series holds two exhibition events annually - the Sprint Unlimited, held at Daytona International Speedway at the start of the season, and the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, held at Charlotte Motor Speedway midway through the season. Both events carry a hefty purse of over USD $1,000,000. NASCAR has also held exhibition races at Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi in Japan and Calder Park Thunderdome in Australia.
