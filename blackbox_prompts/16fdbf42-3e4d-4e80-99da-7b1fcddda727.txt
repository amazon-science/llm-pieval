Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What is the most commonly seen species?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What is the most commonly seen species?")
APIResults: Animals that characterize the Appalachian forests include five species of tree squirrels. The most commonly seen is the low to moderate elevation eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Occupying similar habitat is the slightly larger fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) and the much smaller southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). More characteristic of cooler northern and high elevation habitat is the red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), whereas the Appalachian northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus fuscus), which closely resembles the southern flying squirrel, is confined to northern hardwood and spruce-fir forests.  Human: Investigate tweets to locate those that include the keyword "Superbowl" .
