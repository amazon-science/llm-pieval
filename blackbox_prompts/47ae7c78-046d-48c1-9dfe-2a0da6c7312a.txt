Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What can children do in countries were trading is involved?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What can children do in countries were trading is involved?")
APIResults: The term child labour can be misleading when it confuses harmful work with employment that may be beneficial to children. It can also ignore harmful work outside employment and any benefits children normally derive from their work. Domestic work is an example: all families but the rich must work at cleaning, cooking, caring, and more to maintain their homes. In most families in the world, this process extends to productive activities, especially herding and various types of agriculture, and to a variety of small family businesses. Where trading is a significant feature of social life, children can start trading in small items at an early age, often in the company of family members or of peers..  Human: Summarize for me the essential story and themes inside the volume titled "Peaceful Warrior."
