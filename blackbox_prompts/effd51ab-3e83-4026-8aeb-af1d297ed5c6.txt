Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: The process of faith leads one to what?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "The process of faith leads one to what?")
APIResults: For English Dominican mystics, the mystical experience was not expressed just in one moment of the full knowledge of God, but in the journey of, or process of, faith. This then led to an understanding that was directed toward an experiential knowledge of divinity. It is important to understand, however, that for these mystics it was possible to pursue mystical life without the visions and voices that are usually associated with such a relationship with God. They experienced a mystical process that allowed them, in the end, to experience what they had already gained knowledge of through their faith only..  Human: Inspect the title of every single book to locate those titled Harry Potter
