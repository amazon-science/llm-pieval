Human: Turn on the self-operating vacuum machine .5%), is a Romance language spoken locally in the southeastern trilingual canton of Graub√ºnden, and is designated by Article 4 of the Federal Constitution as a national language along with German, French, and Italian, and in Article 70 as an official language if the authorities communicate with persons who speak Romansh. However, federal laws and other official acts do not need to be decreed in Romansh.
