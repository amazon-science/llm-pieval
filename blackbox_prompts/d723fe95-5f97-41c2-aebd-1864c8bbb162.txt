User: Who stepped up after 2011?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Who stepped up after 2011?")
APIResults: After Kim Jong Il, the second ruler of North Korea, died in December 2011, Kim Jong Un stepped up and began mandating the use of Hanja as a source of definition for the Korean language.  Human: Retrieve all movies that have been marked with "Batman" as a keyword . Currently, it is said that North Korea teaches around 3,000 Hanja characters to North Korean students, and in some cases, the characters appear within advertisements and newspapers. However, it is also said that the authorities implore students not to use the characters in public. Due to North Korea's strict isolationism, accurate reports about hanja use in North Korea are hard to obtain.
