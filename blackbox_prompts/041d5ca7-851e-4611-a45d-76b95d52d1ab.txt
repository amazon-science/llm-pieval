Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What city did NATO bomb on 25 April?")

Human: If convenient, might you access and relay the latest bulletins from my exchanges? . Western officials remained divided over whether Gaddafi was a legitimate military target under the U.N. Security Council resolution.
