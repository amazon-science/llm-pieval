Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: Who created ACE?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Who created ACE?")
APIResults: Many scripts, including Arabic and Devanagari, have special orthographic rules that require certain combinations of letterforms to be combined into special ligature forms.  Human: Try to locate instructions on how to put together tuna salad . The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex, requiring special script-shaping technologies such as ACE (Arabic Calligraphic Engine by DecoType in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard), which became the proof of concept for OpenType (by Adobe and Microsoft), Graphite (by SIL International), or AAT (by Apple).
