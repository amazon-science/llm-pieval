Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What alternate name did Konami use to get around Nintendo's yearly limit?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What alternate name did Konami use to get around Nintendo's yearly limit?")
APIResults: During the NES era, Nintendo maintained exclusive control over titles released for the systemâ€”the company had to approve every game, each third-party developer could only release up to five games per year (but some third parties got around this by using different names, for example Konami's "Ultra Games" brand), those games could not be released on another console within two years, and Nintendo was the exclusive manufacturer and supplier of NES cartridges. However, competition from Sega's console brought an end to this practice; in 1991, Acclaim began releasing games for both platforms, with most of Nintendo's other licensees following suit over the next several years; Capcom (which licensed some games to Sega instead of producing them directly) and Square were the most notable holdouts..
