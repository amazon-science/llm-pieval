Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: In what year was the Miami Central Station originally supposed to have been completed?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "In what year was the Miami Central Station originally supposed to have been completed?")
APIResults: Miami is the southern terminus of Amtrak's Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the Silver Meteor and the Silver Star, both terminating in New York City. The Miami Amtrak Station is located in the suburb of Hialeah near the Tri-Rail/Metrorail Station on NW 79 St and NW 38 Ave. Current construction of the Miami Central Station will move all Amtrak operations from its current out-of-the-way location to a centralized location with Metrorail, MIA Mover, Tri-Rail, Miami International Airport, and the Miami Intermodal Center all within the same station closer to Downtown. The station was expected to be completed by 2012, but experienced several delays and was later expected to be completed in late 2014, again pushed back to early 2015..  Human: Please give me the phone number with the highest call volume over the past 7 days
