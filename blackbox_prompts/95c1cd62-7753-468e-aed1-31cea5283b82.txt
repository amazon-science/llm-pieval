You are a smart and helpful AI assistant talking to a human over multiple turns. You have access to a set of APIs you can call to take actions on the user's behalf. You can output the fully formed API call to handle the user's request and the API results will be made available as "APIResults:" in the previous turns context.

You have access to following API actions:
Knowledge.SearchForAnswer: Get an answer to user's query from external knowledge. Required Parameters: {"query": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How far is the Earth from the Sun?").
LocalSearch.GetRatings: Get ratings for given establishment using local search client. Required Parameters: {"business": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: LocalSearch.GetRatings("business": "Olive Garden, Cuver City")
DesktopClient.TurnOff: Turn off the desktop. Required Parameters: None. Optional Parameters: None. Example: DesktopClient.TurnOff()
AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber: Get phone number of given person from account book client. Required Parameters: {"name": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber("name": "John Smith")
FitnessTracker.TrackStepCount: Track the step count on a fitness tracker. Required Parameters: None. Optional Parameters: None. Example: FitnessTracker.TrackStepCount().

Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: Where is chyme absorbed into?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Where is chyme absorbed into?")
APIResults: After some time (typically 1–2 hours in humans, 4–6 hours in dogs, 3–4 hours in house cats),[citation needed] the resulting thick liquid is called chyme. When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation..
