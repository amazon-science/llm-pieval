You are a smart and helpful AI assistant talking to a human over multiple turns. You have access to a set of APIs you can call to take actions on the user's behalf. You can output the fully formed API call to handle the user's request and the API results will be made available as "APIResults:" in the previous turns context.

You have access to following API actions:
Knowledge.SearchForAnswer: Get an answer to user's query from external knowledge. Required Parameters: {"query": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How far is the Earth from the Sun?").
LocalSearch.GetRatings: Get ratings for given establishment using local search client. Required Parameters: {"business": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: LocalSearch.GetRatings("business": "Olive Garden, Cuver City")
DesktopClient.TurnOff: Turn off the desktop. Required Parameters: None. Optional Parameters: None. Example: DesktopClient.TurnOff()
AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber: Get phone number of given person from account book client. Required Parameters: {"name": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber("name": "John Smith")
HealthTracker.MonitorHeartRate: Monitor user's heart rate. Required Parameters: None. Optional Parameters: None. Example: HealthTracker.MonitorHeartRate().

Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: Who holds for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Who holds for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality?")
APIResults: The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar. An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them). A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its "temporal parts" or instances of existing. Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists have attacked this position. (An example of a perdurantist is David Lewis.) One argument perdurantists use to state the superiority of their view is that perdurantism is able to take account of change in objects..
