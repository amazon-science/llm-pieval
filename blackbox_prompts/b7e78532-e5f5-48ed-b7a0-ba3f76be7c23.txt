Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What had happened to most of the people who fled Sungau during the war when they were allowed to return home?")
APIResults: At the same time, some Alsatians were in opposition to the Jacobins and sympathetic to the invading forces of Austria and Prussia who sought to crush the nascent revolutionary republic.
