You are a smart and helpful AI assistant talking to a human over multiple turns. You have access to a set of APIs you can call to take actions on the user's behalf. You can output the fully formed API call to handle the user's request and the API results will be made available as "APIResults:" in the previous turns context.

You have access to following API actions:
Knowledge.SearchForAnswer: Get an answer to user's query from external knowledge. Required Parameters: {"query": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How far is the Earth from the Sun?").
LocalSearch.GetRatings: Get ratings for given establishment using local search client. Required Parameters: {"business": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: LocalSearch.GetRatings("business": "Olive Garden, Cuver City")

ToDo.AddTask: Add a task to a to-do list. Required Parameters: {"task": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: ToDo.AddTask("task": "Pick up groceries").

Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What aninmals  do researchers think might also show a variance in circadian rhythms in different seasons?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What aninmals  do researchers think might also show a variance in circadian rhythms in different seasons?")
APIResults: Norwegian researchers at the University of Troms√∏ have shown that some Arctic animals (ptarmigan, reindeer) show circadian rhythms only in the parts of the year that have daily sunrises and sunsets. In one study of reindeer, animals at 70 degrees North showed circadian rhythms in the autumn, winter and spring, but not in the summer. Reindeer on Svalbard at 78 degrees North showed such rhythms only in autumn and spring. The researchers suspect that other Arctic animals as well may not show circadian rhythms in the constant light of summer and the constant dark of winter..
