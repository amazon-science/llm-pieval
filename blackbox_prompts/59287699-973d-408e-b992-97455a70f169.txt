Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: As Jews were expelled from England, France, and parts of Germany they head into which three countries?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "As Jews were expelled from England, France, and parts of Germany they head into which three countries?")
APIResults: With the onset of the Crusades in 1095, and the expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as "usurious" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.  Human: Kick off the language learning course emphasizing grammar .
