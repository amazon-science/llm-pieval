User: What was the driving force behind the revitalization of the Roman naval forces?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What was the driving force behind the revitalization of the Roman naval forces?")
APIResults: After having declined in size following the subjugation of the Mediterranean, the Roman navy underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Under Caesar, an invasion fleet was assembled in the English Channel to allow the invasion of Britannia; under Pompey, a large fleet was raised in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea of Cilician pirates. During the civil war that followed, as many as a thousand ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities..
