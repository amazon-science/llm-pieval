Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What case no longer used in Dutch is still present in German phrases like "Der Herr des Hauses"?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What case no longer used in Dutch is still present in German phrases like "Der Herr des Hauses"?")
APIResults: More complex inflection is still found in certain lexicalized expressions like de heer des huizes (literally, the man of the house), etc. These are usually remnants of cases (in this instance, the genitive case which is still used in German, cf. Der Herr des Hauses) and other inflections no longer in general use today. In such lexicalized expressions remnants of strong and weak nouns can be found too, e.g. in het jaar des Heren (Anno Domini), where "-en" is actually the genitive ending of the weak noun. Also in this case, German retains this feature. Though the genitive is widely avoided in speech..  Human: Find comical footage on the online video platform YouTube
