Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What was the name of the son of Osman that captured an Anatolian city?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What was the name of the son of Osman that captured an Anatolian city?")
APIResults: In the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend over the Eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. Osman's son, Orhan, captured the northwestern Anatolian city of Bursa in 1324, and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. This Ottoman conquest meant the loss of Byzantine control over northwestern Anatolia. The important city of Thessaloniki was captured from the Venetians in 1387. The Ottoman victory at Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale crusade of the Middle Ages, failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks..  Human: I would appreciate if you could read the notes I've taken
