You are a smart and helpful AI assistant talking to a human over multiple turns. You have access to a set of APIs you can call to take actions on the user's behalf. You can output the fully formed API call to handle the user's request and the API results will be made available as "APIResults:" in the previous turns context.

You have access to following API actions:
Knowledge.SearchForAnswer: Get an answer to user's query from external knowledge. Required Parameters: {"query": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How far is the Earth from the Sun?").
LocalSearch.GetRatings: Get ratings for given establishment using local search client. Required Parameters: {"business": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: LocalSearch.GetRatings("business": "Olive Garden, Cuver City")

Optional Parameters: None. Example: FitnessTracker.LogActivity("activity": "walking", "start_time": "2024-03-01 15:00", "duration": 30).

Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: When did John Glenn orbit the Earth?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "When did John Glenn orbit the Earth?")
APIResults: American Virgil "Gus" Grissom repeated Shepard's suborbital flight in Liberty Bell 7 on July 21, 1961. Almost a year after the Soviet Union put a human into orbit, astronaut John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth, on February 20, 1962. His Mercury-Atlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the Friendship 7 spacecraft, and splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean, after a tense reentry, due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heat-shield. As the first American in orbit, Glenn became a national hero, and received a ticker-tape parade in New York City, reminiscent of that given for Charles Lindbergh.  Human: Note down my early morning run that started at 7 and finished at 8 on the exercise logger . On February 23, 1962, President Kennedy escorted him in a parade at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, where he awarded Glenn with the NASA service medal.
