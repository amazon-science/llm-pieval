Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: How many are non-printing control characters?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How many are non-printing control characters?")
APIResults: Originally based on the English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart on the right. The characters encoded are numbers 0 to 9, lowercase letters a to z, uppercase letters A to Z, basic punctuation symbols, control codes that originated with Teletype machines, and a space. For example, lowercase j would become binary 1101010 and decimal 106. ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing control characters (many now obsolete) that affect how text and space are processed and 95 printable characters, including the space (which is considered an invisible graphic:223).  Human: Can you provide the most up-to-date pricing on Bitcoin (BTC)? .
