Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: Where was the rheostat mounted?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Where was the rheostat mounted?")
APIResults: In the first half of the twentieth century, almost all elevators had no automatic positioning of the floor on which the cab would stop. Some of the older freight elevators were controlled by switches operated by pulling on adjacent ropes. In general, most elevators before WWII were manually controlled by elevator operators using a rheostat connected to the motor. This rheostat (see picture) was enclosed within a cylindrical container about the size and shape of a cake. This was mounted upright or sideways on the cab wall and operated via a projecting handle, which was able to slide around the top half of the cylinder..  Human: Flip the main circuit breaker switch to off
