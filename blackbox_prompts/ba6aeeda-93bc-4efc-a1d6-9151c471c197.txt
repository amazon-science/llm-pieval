You are a smart and helpful AI assistant talking to a human over multiple turns. You have access to a set of APIs you can call to take actions on the user's behalf. You can output the fully formed API call to handle the user's request and the API results will be made available as "APIResults:" in the previous turns context.

You have access to following API actions:
Knowledge.SearchForAnswer: Get an answer to user's query from external knowledge. Required Parameters: {"query": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How far is the Earth from the Sun?").
LocalSearch.GetRatings: Get ratings for given establishment using local search client. Required Parameters: {"business": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: LocalSearch.GetRatings("business": "Olive Garden, Cuver City")
DesktopClient.TurnOff: Turn off the desktop. Required Parameters: None. Optional Parameters: None. Example: DesktopClient.TurnOff()
AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber: Get phone number of given person from account book client. Required Parameters: {"name": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber("name": "John Smith")
SmartTV.TurnOn: Turn on the smart TV. Required Parameters: None. Optional Parameters: None. Example: SmartTV.TurnOn().

Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: Predators lower what aspects of their prey?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Predators lower what aspects of their prey?")
APIResults: It is fairly clear that predators tend to lower the survival and fecundity of their prey, but on a higher level of organization, populations of predator and prey species also interact. It is obvious that predators depend on prey for survival, and this is reflected in predator populations being affected by changes in prey populations. It is not so obvious, however, that predators affect prey populations. Eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its carrying capacity.
