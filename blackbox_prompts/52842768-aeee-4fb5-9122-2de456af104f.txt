Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: How many fans were injured in Everton's 1948 match against Liverpool that drew the largest crowd they've had?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How many fans were injured in Everton's 1948 match against Liverpool that drew the largest crowd they've had?")
APIResults: The record attendance for an Everton home match is 78,299 against Liverpool on 18 September 1948. Amazingly, there was only 1 injury at this game-Tom Fleetwood was hit on the head by a coin thrown from the crowd whilst he marched around the perimeter with St Edward's Orphanage Band, playing the cornet. Goodison Park, like all major English football grounds since the recommendations of the Taylor Report were implemented, is now an all-seater and only holds just under 40,000, meaning it is unlikely that this attendance record will ever be broken at Goodison. Everton's record transfer paid was to Chelsea for Belgian forward Romelu Lukaku for a sum of Â£28m. Everton bought the player after he played the previous year with the team on loan..  Human: Please provide a list of eateries that offer food delivery to the Culver City area
