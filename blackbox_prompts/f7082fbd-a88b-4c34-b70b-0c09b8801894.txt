User: How many judges and prosecutors does Portugal have per 100,000 inhabitants?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How many judges and prosecutors does Portugal have per 100,000 inhabitants?")
APIResults: In 2005, the number of public employees per thousand inhabitants in the Portuguese government (70.8) was above the European Union average (62.4 per thousand inhabitants). By EU and USA standards, Portugal's justice system was internationally known as being slow and inefficient, and by 2011 it was the second slowest in Western Europe (after Italy); conversely, Portugal has one of the highest rates of judges and prosecutorsâ€”over 30 per 100,000 people. The entire Portuguese public service has been known for its mismanagement, useless redundancies, waste, excess of bureaucracy and a general lack of productivity in certain sectors, particularly in justice.
