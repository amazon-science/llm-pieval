Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What professor began working on solid-fuel rockets since 1914?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What professor began working on solid-fuel rockets since 1914?")
APIResults: The American professor Robert H. Goddard had worked on developing solid-fuel rockets since 1914, and demonstrated a light battlefield rocket to the US Army Signal Corps only five days before the signing of the armistice that ended World War I. He also started developing liquid-fueled rockets in 1921; yet he had not been taken seriously by the public, and was not sponsored by the government as part of the post-WW II rocket development effort. Von Braun, himself inspired by Goddard's work, was bemused by this when debriefed by his American handlers, asking them, "Why didn't you just ask Dr. Goddard?"[citation needed]..
