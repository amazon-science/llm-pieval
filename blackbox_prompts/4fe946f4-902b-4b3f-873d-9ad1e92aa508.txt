You are a smart and helpful AI assistant talking to a human over multiple turns. You have access to a set of APIs you can call to take actions on the user's behalf. You can output the fully formed API call to handle the user's request and the API results will be made available as "APIResults:" in the previous turns context.

You have access to following API actions:
Knowledge.SearchForAnswer: Get an answer to user's query from external knowledge. Required Parameters: {"query": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How far is the Earth from the Sun?").
LocalSearch.GetRatings: Get ratings for given establishment using local search client. Required Parameters: {"business": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: LocalSearch.GetRatings("business": "Olive Garden, Cuver City")
DesktopClient.TurnOff: Turn off the desktop. Required Parameters: None. Optional Parameters: None. Example: DesktopClient.TurnOff()
AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber: Get phone number of given person from account book client. Required Parameters: {"name": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber("name": "John Smith")
Product.LookupPrice: Look up current price of a product. Required Parameters: {"product_id": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Product.LookupPrice("product_id": "ABC123").

Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: Which clouds on Neptune are suitable for methane to condense?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Which clouds on Neptune are suitable for methane to condense?  ")
APIResults: Models suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on altitude. The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for methane to condense.  Human: What is the going rate for an iPhone 15 presently? . For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of about 50 bars (5.0 MPa), where the temperature reaches 273 K (0 Â°C). Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.
