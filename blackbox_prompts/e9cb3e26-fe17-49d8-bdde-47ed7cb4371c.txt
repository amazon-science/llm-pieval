Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: Who awarded a teaching license in European schools?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Who awarded a teaching license in European schools?")
APIResults: The Arabic term ij훮zat al-tadr카s was awarded to Islamic scholars who were qualified to teach. According to Makdisi, the Latin title licentia docendi 'licence to teach' in the European university may have been a translation of the Arabic, but the underlying concept was very different. A significant difference between the ij훮zat al-tadr카s and the licentia docendi was that the former was awarded by the individual scholar-teacher, while the latter was awarded by the chief official of the university, who represented the collective faculty, rather than the individual scholar-teacher.
