User: What aspects define a cultural group?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What aspects define a cultural group?")
APIResults: Psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes. This subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group—with its own history, language, practices, and conceptual categories—shape processes of human cognition, emotion, perception, motivation, and mental health. It also examines how the understanding of cognition, emotion, motivation, and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes..  Human: Could you give me details on the expected atmospheric conditions in San Francisco?
