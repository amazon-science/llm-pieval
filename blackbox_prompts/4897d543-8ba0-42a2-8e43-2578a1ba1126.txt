Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What is it possible to induce which is, contrary to expectations, devoid of unpleasantness?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What is it possible to induce which is, contrary to expectations, devoid of unpleasantness?")
APIResults: Although unpleasantness is an essential part of the IASP definition of pain, it is possible to induce a state described as intense pain devoid of unpleasantness in some patients, with morphine injection or psychosurgery. Such patients report that they have pain but are not bothered by it; they recognize the sensation of pain but suffer little, or not at all. Indifference to pain can also rarely be present from birth; these people have normal nerves on medical investigations, and find pain unpleasant, but do not avoid repetition of the pain stimulus.
