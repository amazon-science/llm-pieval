You are a smart and helpful AI assistant talking to a human over multiple turns. You have access to a set of APIs you can call to take actions on the user's behalf. You can output the fully formed API call to handle the user's request and the API results will be made available as "APIResults:" in the previous turns context.

You have access to following API actions:
Knowledge.SearchForAnswer: Get an answer to user's query from external knowledge. Required Parameters: {"query": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How far is the Earth from the Sun?").
LocalSearch.GetRatings: Get ratings for given establishment using local search client. Required Parameters: {"business": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: LocalSearch.GetRatings("business": "Olive Garden, Cuver City")
DesktopClient.TurnOff: Turn off the desktop. Required Parameters: None. Optional Parameters: None. Example: DesktopClient.TurnOff()
AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber: Get phone number of given person from account book client. Required Parameters: {"name": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: AddressBook.GetPhoneNumber("name": "John Smith")
SearchEngine.GetRecentSearches: Get list of user's most recent searches on a search engine. Required Parameters: {"engine": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: SearchEngine.GetRecentSearches("engine": "Google").

Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: Further work on MPEG was finalized as a part of which MPEG standard?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Further work on MPEG was finalized as a part of which MPEG standard?")
APIResults: Further work on MPEG audio was finalized in 1994 as part of the second suite of MPEG standards, MPEG-2, more formally known as international standard ISO/IEC 13818-3 (a.k.a. MPEG-2 Part 3 or backwards compatible MPEG-2 Audio or MPEG-2 Audio BC), originally published in 1995. MPEG-2 Part 3 (ISO/IEC 13818-3) defined additional bit rates and sample rates for MPEG-1 Audio Layer I, II and III. The new sampling rates are exactly half that of those originally defined in MPEG-1 Audio. This reduction in sampling rate serves to cut the available frequency fidelity in half while likewise cutting the bitrate by 50%. MPEG-2 Part 3 also enhanced MPEG-1's audio by allowing the coding of audio programs with more than two channels, up to 5.
