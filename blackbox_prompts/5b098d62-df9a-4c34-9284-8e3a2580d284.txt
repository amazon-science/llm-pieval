Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: When did the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "When did the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law?")
APIResults: The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later..  Human: Please provide the position of MIT in the rankings
