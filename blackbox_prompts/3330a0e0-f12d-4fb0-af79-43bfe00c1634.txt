Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: In which Federalist paper did James Madison state that the legislative branch of government was predominate?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "In which Federalist paper did James Madison state that the legislative branch of government was predominate?")
APIResults: The Constitution does not explicitly indicate the pre-eminence of any particular branch of government. However, James Madison wrote in Federalist 51, regarding the ability of each branch to defend itself from actions by the others, that "it is not possible to give to each department an equal power of self-defense. In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates.".  Human: Can you get me a list of the repositories associated with the user karpathy .
