User: When did the Buerau take over and begin to expant the ATC system?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "When did the Buerau take over and begin to expant the ATC system?")
APIResults: The Aeronautics Branch was renamed the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934 to reflect its enhanced status within the Department. As commercial flying increased, the Bureau encouraged a group of airlines to establish the first three centers for providing air traffic control (ATC) along the airways. In 1936, the Bureau itself took over the centers and began to expand the ATC system. The pioneer air traffic controllers used maps, blackboards, and mental calculations to ensure the safe separation of aircraft traveling along designated routes between cities..
