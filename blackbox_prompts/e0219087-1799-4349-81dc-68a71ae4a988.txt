User: How many women were on Ohio's death row in 1991?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How many women were on Ohio's death row in 1991?")
APIResults: Previous post-Furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico, when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty. In 1991, outgoing Ohio Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners, among them all four women on the state's death row. And during his two terms (1979â€“1987) as Florida's Governor, Bob Graham, although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-Furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of "possible innocence" or "disproportionality.  Human: Receive advised accommodations in the city of San Francisco .".
