Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What is the nationality of the company that makes pentobarbital?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What is the nationality of the company that makes pentobarbital?")
APIResults: In the 2010s, American jurisdictions have experienced a shortage of lethal injection drugs, due to anti-death penalty advocacy and low production volume. Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011. The European Union has outlawed the export of any product that could be used in an execution; this has prevented executioners from using EU-manufactured anesthetics like propofol which are needed for general medical purposes. Another alternative, pentobarbital, is also only manufactured in the European Union, which has caused the Danish producer to restrict distribution to U.S. government customers..
