User: What type of excercise has shown the best benefit for the brain?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What type of excercise has shown the best benefit for the brain?")
APIResults: Physical exercise, particularly continuous aerobic exercises such as running, cycling and swimming, has many cognitive benefits and effects on the brain. Influences on the brain include increases in neurotransmitter levels, improved oxygen and nutrient delivery, and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus.  Human: I'd like to know what page I'm on in this book I have with me at the moment . The effects of exercise on memory have important implications for improving children's academic performance, maintaining mental abilities in old age, and the prevention and potential cure of neurological diseases.
