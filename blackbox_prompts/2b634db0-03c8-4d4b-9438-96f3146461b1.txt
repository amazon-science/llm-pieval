User: Who did not have faith in MacArthur's claim that victory was the only respectable outcome?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "Who did not have faith in MacArthur's claim that victory was the only respectable outcome?")
APIResults: On 11 April 1951, Commander-in-Chief Truman relieved the controversial General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Korea. There were several reasons for the dismissal. MacArthur had crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses. He believed that whether or not to use nuclear weapons should be his own decision, not the President's. MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution. MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the U.S. Constitution.

A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.
