Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: How many people were killed by bomb drops during the first World War?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How many people were killed by bomb drops during the first World War?")
APIResults: The attitude of the Air Ministry was in contrast to the experiences of the First World War when a few German bombers caused physical and psychological damage out of all proportion to their numbers. Around 280 short tons (250 t) (9,000 bombs) had been dropped, killing 1,413 people and injuring 3,500 more. Most people aged 35 or over remembered the threat and greeted the bombings with great trepidation. From 1916â€“1918, German raids had diminished against countermeasures which demonstrated defence against night air raids was possible..
