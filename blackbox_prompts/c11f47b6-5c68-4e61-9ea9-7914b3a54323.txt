Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What do many scholars regard the Late Middle Ages as the beginning of?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What do many scholars regard the Late Middle Ages as the beginning of?")
APIResults: The changes brought about by these developments have led many scholars to view this period as the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of modern history and early modern Europe. However, the division is somewhat artificial, since ancient learning was never entirely absent from European society. As a result there was developmental continuity between the ancient age (via classical antiquity) and the modern age. Some historians, particularly in Italy, prefer not to speak of the late Middle Ages at all, but rather see the high period of the Middle Ages transitioning to the Renaissance and the modern era.
