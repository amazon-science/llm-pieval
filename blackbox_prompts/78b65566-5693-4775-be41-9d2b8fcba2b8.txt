Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What is the area closest to the continental US called?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What is the area closest to the continental US called?")
APIResults: Also referred to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest to the rest of the United States.  Human: Log out the admin user from the desktop system . As such, this was where most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase. The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital Juneau, the former capital Sitka, and Ketchikan, at one time Alaska's largest city. The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities (Haines, Hyder and Skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system.
