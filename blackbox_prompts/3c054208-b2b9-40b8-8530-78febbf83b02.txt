User: IP benefits concentrated interests to whose detriment?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "IP benefits concentrated interests to whose detriment?")
APIResults: Some critics of intellectual property, such as those in the free culture movement, point at intellectual monopolies as harming health (in the case of pharmaceutical patents), preventing progress, and benefiting concentrated interests to the detriment of the masses, and argue that the public interest is harmed by ever-expansive monopolies in the form of copyright extensions, software patents, and business method patents. More recently scientists and engineers are expressing concern that patent thickets are undermining technological development even in high-tech fields like nanotechnology..
