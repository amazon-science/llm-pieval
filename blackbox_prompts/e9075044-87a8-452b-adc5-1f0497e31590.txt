Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: By What time period was the Sahara dry like it is today?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "By What time period was the Sahara dry like it is today?")
APIResults:  Human: Bring up the inventory of my latest rummages on my search engine .By 3400 BCE, the Sahara was as dry as it is today, due to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures resulting from a shift in the Earth's orbit. As a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape. Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.
