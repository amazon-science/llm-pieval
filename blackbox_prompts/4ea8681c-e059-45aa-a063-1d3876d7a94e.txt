Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: On what day did the Spanish see the island they named Corrales?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "On what day did the Spanish see the island they named Corrales?")
APIResults: The Spanish ship San Pedro and two other vessels in an expedition commanded by Miguel L처pez de Legazpi discovered an island on January 9, 1530, possibly Mejit, at 10째N, which they named "Los Barbudos". The Spaniards went ashore and traded with the local inhabitants. On January 10, the Spaniards sighted another island that they named "Placeres", perhaps Ailuk; ten leagues away, they sighted another island that they called "Pajares" (perhaps Jemo). On January 12, they sighted another island at 10째N that they called "Corrales" (possibly Wotho). On January 15, the Spaniards sighted another low island, perhaps Ujelang, at 10째N, where they described the people on "Barbudos". After that, ships including the San Jeronimo, Los Reyes and Todos los Santos also visited the islands in different years.
