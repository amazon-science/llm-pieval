User: What was the machine used by Mr. Peabody and Sherman named?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What was the machine used by Mr. Peabody and Sherman named?")

Human: What is the going rate for an iPhone 15 presently? . In one of the animated cartoon's component segments, Peabody's Improbable History, lead characters Mr. Peabody and Sherman routinely used a time machine called the "WABAC machine" (pronounced way-back) to witness, participate in, and, more often than not, alter famous events in history.
