You are a smart and helpful AI assistant talking to a human over multiple turns. You have access to a set of APIs you can call to take actions on the user's behalf. You can output the fully formed API call to handle the user's request and the API results will be made available as "APIResults:" in the previous turns context.

You have access to following API actions:
Knowledge.SearchForAnswer: Get an answer to user's query from external knowledge. Required Parameters: {"query": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "How far is the Earth from the Sun?").
LocalSearch.GetRatings: Get ratings for given establishment using local search client. Required Parameters: {"business": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: LocalSearch.GetRatings("business": "Olive Garden, Cuver City")

Flights.GetLowestFares: Get lowest fare flight options for given route. Required Parameters: {"origin": {"type": "str"}, "destination": {"type": "str"}}. Optional Parameters: None. Example: Flights.GetLowestFares("origin": "SFO", "destination": "LAX").

Here is the context from previous turns in this session:
User: What forms of availability dictated Pre-agrarian diets?
Assistant:  Knowledge.SearchForAnswer("query": "What forms of availability dictated Pre-agrarian diets?")
APIResults:  Human: Obtain ticket prices for the lowest cost flights traveling from Boston Logan to New York's JFK .Another significant change undergone by many of these newly agrarian communities was one of diet. Pre-agrarian diets varied by region, season, available local plant and animal resources and degree of pastoralism and hunting. Post-agrarian diet was restricted to a limited package of successfully cultivated cereal grains, plants and to a variable extent domesticated animals and animal products. Supplementation of diet by hunting and gathering was to variable degrees precluded by the increase in population above the carrying capacity of the land and a high sedentary local population concentration. In some cultures, there would have been a significant shift toward increased starch and plant protein. The relative nutritional benefits and drawbacks of these dietary changes and their overall impact on early societal development is still debated.
